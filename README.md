:call_me_hand: **Good Day! I'm Connor (or GLorn)** :call_me_hand:

Outside of coding I am a passionate Swimmer :swimmer: Gamer :joystick: and Film Watcher :clapper:

I'm currently Learning Python, SQL and Machine Learning @ NOD Coding Bootcamp in Stockholm, Sweden :sweden:

I'm always learning and will snatch up any opportunities to better my code! (Suggestions Welcome :eyes:)
